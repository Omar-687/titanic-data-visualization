# Titanic Data Visualization

This project focuses on **visualizing the Titanic passenger dataset** using **Power BI** and **R**.

The dataset used is `titanic_survival_data.csv`, sourced from [OpenML: Titanic](https://www.openml.org/d/40945). It includes passenger details such as survival status, gender, age, class, and fares.

To view the visualizations:  
1. Open the file `titanic_survival_power_bi_visualisation` in **Power BI**.  
2. Enable **R script visuals** to run the R scripts embedded in the report.
